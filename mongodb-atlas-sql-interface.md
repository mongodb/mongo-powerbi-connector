## Prerequisites
To use the MongoDB Atlas SQL connector, you must have an 
[Atlas federated database](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-federation/) setup.
> [!NOTE]
> If some or all of your data comes from an Atlas cluster, you must use MongoDB version 5.0 or greater for that cluster 
> to take advantage of Atlas SQL.

We also recommend to install the MongoDB Atlas SQL ODBC Driver before using the MongoDB Atlas SQL connector.

## Connect to your MongoDB Atlas federated database using Atlas SQL interface

To connect using the Atlas SQL interface :

1. Get your federated database instance connection information
   - Navigate to your federated database instance. In Atlas, select **Data Federation** from the left navigation panel.
   - Click **Connect** to open the federated database instance connection modal.
   - Select **Connect using the Atlas SQL Interface**.
   - Select **PowerBI Desktop**.
   - Copy your federated database name and MongoDB URI. You'll need them in a later step.

2. Select **Get Data** from the **Home** ribbon in Power BI Desktop.

3. Select **Database** from the categories on the left, select **MongoDB Atlas SQL**, and then select **Connect**.

4. If this is the first time you're connecting to MongoDB Atlas SQL connector, a third-party notice will be displayed. 
   Select **"Don't warn me again with this connector"** if you don't want this message to be displayed again.

   Select **Continue**. 

5. In the MongoDB Atlas SQL window that appears, fill in the following values:
   - The **MongoDB URI**. _Required_.   
     Use the MongoDB URI you obtained in step 1.  Make sure that it does not contain your username and password. URIs containing username and/or passwords will be rejected.
   -  Your federated **Database** name. _Required_  
      Use the name of the federated database you obtained in step 1.
   - A **SQL statement**.  _Optional_
   
   Select **Continue**. 
6. Enter your Atlas MongoDB Database access username and password and select **Connect**.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Once you enter your username and password for a particular Atlas federated database, Power BI Desktop uses those 
   > same credentials in subsequent connection attempts. You can modify those credentials by going to **File > Options 
   > and settings > Data source settings**.  
   > More information: [Change the authentication method](../connector-authentication.md#change-the-authentication-method)

7. In **Navigator**, select one or multiple elements to import and use in Power BI Desktop. 
   Then select either **Load** to load the table in Power BI Desktop, or **Transform Data** to open the Power Query 
   Editor where you can filter and refine the set of data you want to use, and then load that refined set of data into 
   Power BI Desktop.

## Troubleshooting

When the connection cannot be established successfully, the generic error message 
`The driver returned invalid (or failed to return) SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER: 03.80` is diplayed.
Start by checking your credentials and that you have no network issues accessing your federated database.
